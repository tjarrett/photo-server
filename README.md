# Nodejs Photo Sync Server

Life interrupted this project back in late 2016. However, the plan for this project is and was to provide a way to have photos auto-sync from your mobile device to your own computer. Sort of an Apple Photos or Google Photos replacement without needing to pay for hosting or monkey around with a 3rd party cloud provider.
